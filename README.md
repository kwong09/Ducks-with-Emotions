# Ducks with Emotions
Choose from the four buttons at the bottom of the screen to choose how you are feeling today. Music for each feeling is provided in hopes to make you feel happier when you are feeling down! It's also fun to see a little duck on your screen so that you can relate to your duck's emotions. For people who are sensitive to sound, I included a mute button for you to mute the music. Some text above the ducks gives your reassurance for how you are feeling!
